## CI/CD Track

Every subfolder has at least a presentation file in it except for:

* There's No Nice Way to Say This: Your DevOps Has Gone Horribly Wrong by Kalle Sirkesalo
* CI/CD for Machine Learning - Sasha Rosenbaum
* Being Budget Conscious in a Continuously Automated World by Sasha Rosenbaum

These missing presentations could be from me missing the link, the presentation not being shared or it currently being mis-sorted in this repo.
