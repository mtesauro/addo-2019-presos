## Cloud Native Infrastructure

Every subfolder has at least a presentation file in it except for:

* Can Kubernetes Keep a Secret? by Omer Levi Hevroni
* What You See Is What You Get For AWS Infrastructure by Anton Babenko
* Event-Driven Computing with Kubernetes by Jakob Ehn
* DevOps to the Next Level with Serverless ChatOps by Jan de Vries
* Building Modular Infrastructure in Code by Fergal Dearle
* Well-Controlled Operations for your AWS Infrastructure by Syed Hamid Rasool
* Deploying Microservices to AWS Fargate by Ariane Gadd
* Effective Docker and Kubernetes for Java EE Developers by Reza Rahman

These missing presentations could be from me missing the link, the presentation not being shared or it currently being mis-sorted in this repo.
